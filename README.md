This repo contains jupyter notebooks for all the deep learning courses under Deep Learning Specialization in coursera. Namely:
C1) Neural Networks and Deep Learning
C2) Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
C3) Structuring Machine Learning Projects
C4) Convolutional Neural Networks
C5) Sequence Models
I suggest you use this for reference only and try to solve the notebooks yourself.
